"""What /rooms shows: the incremental rooms index, and the walk it falls back to.

Two files' worth of concern in one module because they are the same concern. `/rooms`
answers three questions about every listable room — recency order, a count, a byte total —
and there are exactly two ways to answer them: read the maintained index, or walk `rooms/`.
Splitting the two across modules put the fast path and its fallback in places that could
drift apart, and the review this code was written under found precisely that drift: an
index that was authoritative in one place and best-effort in another. Here the choice
between them is made once, in `listing()`, and both answers have the same type.

`extra`, not core: `sz.py`'s `EXTRA_FILES` reports this file without counting it against
the per-file ceiling that `just check` enforces on `core/store.py`. That ceiling was at
zero headroom, so a subsystem of this size could not have landed in core at all — see the
per-file caps in `sz-baseline.json` and CONTRIBUTING's line-tradeoff rule.

Circular import, deliberately. This module needs core's primitives (`_locked`, `_replace`,
`_listable`, `room_path`, `_walk`) and core's read/write paths need this module. The edge
is safe because neither side touches the other's attributes while the other is still
initialising: every use below happens inside a function body, at call time, by which point
both modules are complete. `manifest.py` already imports `store` the same way; this only
adds the reverse edge.

The index itself is append-only JSONL, one `{room, mtime, size}` line per write:

- **Written** by `observe()` on every `append()`, one line, never a rewrite — a read-
  modify-rewrite over the whole file would be O(rooms) per message, which is the cost this
  file exists to avoid.
- **Compacted** by `compact()`, which publishes a full snapshot atomically with every
  line appended since the snapshot's walk carried onto its tail, so an append and a
  publish cannot lose each other's work.
- **Read** by `listing()` down to a page, or by `read()` whole; a missing, truncated or
  unparseable file reads as empty and sends the caller to the walk rather than to a
  snapshot that is silently missing rooms.

Invariant worth stating once: **the index pathname exists only when it is complete.**
`observe()` will not create it, so a fresh store walks exactly as it did before this file
existed, until the first reaper pass seeds the index from a full walk. A one-line index on
a store holding hundreds of thousands of rooms would read as authoritative and hide every
room but one.

    The reader takes the last line per room, so duplicate lines are fine: one ~60-byte
    JSON object, folded away at the next compaction.

    Concurrency (the finding this version exists to fix): the append holds
    `ROOMS_INDEX_LOCK` **shared** while compaction holds it **exclusive** across its
    re-read and publish. An append is therefore either wholly before the compactor's
    re-read — its line is carried onto the staging file — or wholly after the replace,
    opening the new inode. There is no window in which a committed room write's index line
    is dropped. Shared rather than none, so appenders exclude only the publisher and never
    each other; no deadlock, because the exclusive holder takes no other lock while it
    holds this one.

    On any `OSError` while an index exists the file is renamed aside rather than left
    behind: a failed append means the index no longer describes the store, and a later
    read must walk instead of serving a snapshot that is silently missing rooms. The
    exists-check rides inside the same shared hold so a quarantine can never land between
    check and append and slip a partial file in behind itself.

    A file that is *already* gone is not re-created from this one line. Re-creating it
    here would break the invariant this module states outright — the pathname exists only
    when it is complete — and the breach is reachable, not theoretical: two appenders
    that both hit an unwritable index, where the first quarantines and the second then
    writes its single line into a store holding thousands of rooms. `read()` would return
    that one room as a complete index and `/rooms` would serve a page of one. Absent

    **No path here stats every room.** That is the whole point of the index: at
    production size the walk is ~2275 ms and ~239k syscalls per request. The index path
    costs one file read plus at most `limit` stats — the re-stat exists because the index
    mtime can be stale (an external `utime`, or an appender that recorded before the

    so the entry is dropped and the next newest backfills: a `limit` request returns
    `limit` rooms while any exist, rather than a page short by however many died.

    Totals are the index's own view — `len` and a sum over already-parsed entries, no
